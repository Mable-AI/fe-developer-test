## Rollup : Module Bundler 

As current repo build system and component bundler is very inefficient, We can use `RollUp`: a Module Bundler widely used for **`npm Packages`**.

Why would you choose one approach over the other?
- Rollup is better for library building 
- Smaller Bundle Size : Rollup Tress shaking is better than tsup resulting is smaller bundle size
- Rollup gives us more control over output formats, and optimizations.
